# 🧬 AI & Cybersecurity Research Lab

Welcome to my central research hub. This repository contains my major projects and experiments in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Agents, and Cyber-Defense.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🛡️ Autonomous AI Cyber-Defense Framework
A self-healing infrastructure experiment where Red and Blue AI agents automate the vulnerability lifecycle.
- **V1 (Legacy):** Initial proof of concept.
- **V2 (Current):** Advanced orchestrator with CI/CD, automatic patching, and rollback logic.
- [**Framework**](https://github.com/Nezheg0l/my-projects/tree/main/autonomous-cyber-defense)

### 🛡️ Deep-Fake Ecosystem: Autonomous AI Honeypot & Self-Healing Infrastructure
An advanced AI-driven cybersecurity ecosystem deployed on an air-gapped server. This project merges **Active Defense (Deception)** with **Self-Healing architectures**.
- **V1 (Legacy):** Demonstrated the ability to rewrite vulnerable code into secure, parameterized structures.
- **V2 (Current):** Captured logs showing the Honeypot intercepting `ls` and `cat` commands, followed by a triggered Rickroll redirect.
- [**Framework**](https://github.com/Nezheg0l/my-projects/tree/main/AI%20protection%20against%20script%20kiderop)
